    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Embarking on the journey to achieve AWS certification can be an exciting opportunity for professionals in Pakistan. However, recent changes in the way exams are conducted have introduced some challenges for exam takers in the country. Previously, there were multiple options available for registering for the exam, including a more flexible choice called [PSI](https://www.psiexams.com/). But now, AWS has shifted to using only [Pearson VUE](https://home.pearsonvue.com/) as the test delivery provider, which has stricter rules. One significant issue that has emerged is the inability to make exam payments using cards from Pakistan. This poses a problem for individuals trying to register for their exams. Having recently encountered this obstacle during my own AWS certification exam, I feel compelled to share some helpful tips for fellow candidates to navigate the registration process.\n",

    "It's important to note that the main issue lies with *Pearson VUE's payment method*, which currently *does not accept card payments from Pakistan*. However, *if you have a voucher that covers the entire exam fee, you can bypass this problem and easily register for your exam.*\n",

    "## Challenges with Pearson VUE Exam Registration\n",
    "Navigating the exam registration process with Pearson VUE can present some difficulties. When you reach the checkout page, you will encounter a few crucial steps that might pose obstacles:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Payment Method Selection**: Pearson VUE requires you to choose a payment method, such as VISA, MasterCard, or American Express, for paying the exam fees.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Vouchers and Promotion Codes**: You have the option to apply any vouchers or promotion codes you may have. If you have a voucher that covers the full exam fee, it will be deducted automatically, and you can proceed with registration without any issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Entering Payment and Billing Information**: You need to provide accurate payment and billing information that matches the details associated with your selected payment method.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the problem arises when you click 'Next' to move forward. At this point, Pearson VUE displays an error message stating, `The credit card payment option is not available for this order. If you need additional information, please contact customer service.` This error leaves you stuck and unable to proceed with the registration process.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Drawbacks of Pearson VUE\n",
    "\n",
    "There are certain limitations associated with Pearson VUE that you should be aware of. One major limitation is the inability to register for an onsite test center exam through Pearson VUE. They do not accept card payments for this option from Pakistan, and I could not find a workaround for this option within their system. **Consequently, the only viable alternative is to opt for the Online Proctoring exam.**\n",

    "In this section, I will provide you with a detailed walkthrough of the steps involved in registering for your exam using the Online Proctoring option. By following these steps, you can successfully complete your registration process."

    "### Step 1: Accessing Your AWS Certification Account with CertMetrics\n",
    "To begin the registration process, you need to access your [AWS Certification](https://www.aws.training/certification) account, which is managed through **CertMetrics**, a trusted third-party service provider. Follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Go to the AWS Certification website. \n",
    "2. Login to your AWS Certification account using your credentials. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once logged in, you will land on your account's homepage, which will resemble the example shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/2023-05-29-tips-aws-cert-pearsonvue-online-pakistan/certmetric-home.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Navigate to your profile page by clicking on \"My profile\" in the menu bar.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the profile page, locate the section titled **Mailing address - This section requires input in English (Roman) alphabet.** This is where you have provided your address details.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Under this section, modify the country from \"Pakistan\" to \"Sri Lanka,\" as depicted in the screenshot below. Then, click the \"Update/Confirm\" button at the bottom to save the changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/2023-05-29-tips-aws-cert-pearsonvue-online-pakistan/change-country.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "::: {.callout-tip}\n",

    "You only need to change the country, and the rest of the details can remain unchanged. There is no need to modify any other information.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "**Now, you may be wondering why you need to change only the country to \"Sri Lanka\" and why it matters:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Pearson VUE uses the country value from this field to verify your country of origin. If it remains as \"Pakistan,\" card payments will not be accepted. Although Pearson VUE shows the country field again on the \"Enter payment and billing information\" page, modifying it there will not have any effect, and you will still encounter issues during registration. Therefore, it is crucial to update your country from the CertMetrics profile before proceeding with exam registration through Pearson VUE.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Why specifically \"Sri Lanka\"? While you can attempt other countries, it's important to note that some countries have taxes applicable to exam fees, which would be added to the total cost. During my own exploration, I tested various options such as India, UAE, Ireland, and Afghanistan before settling on \"Sri Lanka.\" India, UAE, and Ireland have additional taxes, while Pearson VUE does not accept card payments from Afghanistan. Hence, \"Sri Lanka\" emerged as a suitable choice without any tax implications."
