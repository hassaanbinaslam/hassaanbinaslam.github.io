In [Part 2](https://hassaanbinaslam.github.io/posts/2025-07-30-the-horse-in-motion-ffmpeg-gotchas-part-2.html), we took our code to the cloud, navigating the world of static builds and Lambda Layers to run our process on AWS. We found a pre-built binary that worked, but it wasn't perfect. We had to compromise, giving up the high-quality `libx264` encoder to get the `drawtext` filter we needed.\n",

        "Let me start with a serious word of caution. **I do not recommend this lightly.** Building FFmpeg from source is a journey into a complex world of libraries, dependencies, and cryptic configuration flags. It took me seven or eight attempts to find the right combination of library versions and compile options. You will likely wander into strange dependency rabbit holes and have to start over. Before you go down this path, exhaust all options for pre-built binaries.\n",
        "\n",
        "But if you must, this guide is for you. By compiling it ourselves, we can create a lean, mean, purpose-built FFmpeg binary that has *exactly* what we need—`libx264` and `drawtext`—and nothing we don't. Our final binary will be significantly smaller and perfectly tailored for our AWS Lambda function.\n",
