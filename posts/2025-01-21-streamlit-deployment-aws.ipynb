    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "I recently embarked on a journey to rapidly prototype a personal LLM application. Like many developers, I was drawn to Streamlit for its simplicity and Python-first approach. The ability to quickly design interactive UIs without wrestling with HTML or CSS made it the perfect fit. However, the road to deploying that Streamlit app on AWS turned out to be much more challenging than I initially anticipated. I naively thought that containerizing my app with Docker would be the golden ticket, and I'd be up and running in no time. I was wrong! This post will take you through my learning experience, detailing the various approaches I tried to host the Streamlit application on the AWS cloud, and share what I learned through the process. From serverless lambda functions to dedicated virtual machines, I'll describe what worked, what didn’t, and most importantly, why. By the end of the post, I hope that my experience helps you avoid the pitfalls and saves you from many days of frustration. Let's begin!"

    "## The Initial Assumption: Docker + Cloud = Easy Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "With my Streamlit application working perfectly on my local machine, I confidently assumed the next step would be straightforward. \"Dockerize it, and deploy it to the cloud,\" I thought. After all, Docker simplifies application packaging, and cloud platforms like AWS are built for containerized apps, right? My understanding was that the cloud provided a wide array of services to host containerized apps, automatically managing network configurations, and quickly exposing my app through a public URL. I naively believed it would be a seamless and fast process.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand where I went wrong, it's helpful to understand the internal architecture of Streamlit. As shown in the diagram below, a Streamlit application consists of three main parts: a React-based frontend, a [Tornado web server](https://www.tornadoweb.org/), and the Streamlit library. The React frontend is responsible for rendering the user interface, while the Tornado web server manages the application's logic and communication with the frontend. What's crucial is that the frontend and the Tornado web server communicate through the `WebSocket protocol`, enabling real-time, bi-directional communication. This is a key detail which is easy to overlook when starting out.\n",

    "## First Attempt: The Serverless Approach with AWS Lambda\n",
    "\n",
    "Given my initial goal of quick prototyping and a preference for serverless architectures, [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) seemed like the ideal first choice. It promised a cost-effective and low-maintenance solution where I could just upload my code and let AWS handle the infrastructure.

My understanding was that this would be the easiest, cheapest, and fastest way to make my app accessible to others.\n",
