    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "I recently embarked on a journey to rapidly prototype a personal LLM application. Like many developers, I was drawn to Streamlit for its simplicity and Python-first approach. The ability to quickly design interactive UIs without wrestling with HTML or CSS made it the perfect fit. However, the road to deploying that Streamlit app on AWS turned out to be much more challenging than I initially anticipated. I naively thought that containerizing my app with Docker would be the golden ticket, and I'd be up and running in no time. I was wrong! This post will take you through my learning experience, detailing the various approaches I tried to host the Streamlit application on the AWS cloud, and share what I learned through the process. From serverless lambda functions to dedicated virtual machines, I'll describe what worked, what didn’t, and most importantly, why. By the end of the post, I hope that my experience helps you avoid the pitfalls and saves you from many days of frustration. Let's begin!"

    "With my Streamlit application working perfectly on my local machine, I confidently assumed the next step would be straightforward. \"Dockerize it, and deploy it to the cloud,\" I thought. After all, Docker simplifies application packaging, and cloud platforms like AWS are built for containerized apps, right?

I naively believed it would be a seamless and fast process.\n",

    "To understand where I went wrong, it's helpful to understand the internal architecture of Streamlit. As shown in the diagram below (inspired by the post: [Streamlit vs HTMX](https://medium.com/@prestonblckbrn/streamlit-vs-htmx-llm-streaming-chatbots-783708e3cddb)), a Streamlit application consists of three main parts:\n",

What's crucial is that the frontend and the Tornado web server communicate through the `WebSocket protocol`, enabling real-time, bi-directional communication.

With a few clicks, you can provision a virtual server, and also it has predictable and budget-friendly pricing, making it an attractive option for various projects. Moreover, unlike App Runner, Lightsail's container service provides a dedicated virtual server to run your container. And not only that it also gives a public URL to access your web app. Lightsail basically offers an alternative and simplified version of services such as instances, containers, databases, storage, and more to get your web application up and running in just a few clicks. This makes it an excellent choice for rapid prototyping, proof-of-concept projects, and developers seeking a hassle-free experience.\n",

    "## The Final Piece: Deploying Streamlit with Fargate and AWS CDK\n",
    "\n",
    "While the success with Lightsail was encouraging, I still felt the need for a solution that gave me greater transparency and control over my infrastructure. Lightsail is fantastic for quick deployments and prototypes, but it still abstracts away certain complexities that I wanted to manage myself. I started researching alternative approaches, keeping my desire for rapid setup and customization in mind. This led me to a solution based on AWS Fargate, fronted by an Application Load Balancer, and using the AWS CDK for infrastructure as code.\n",

    "As illustrated in the architectural diagram below, the client browser connects to an Application Load Balancer, which then routes the traffic to the Fargate container running the Streamlit application.\n",

    "At first, the thought of setting up a full-fledged ECS cluster with Fargate and a load balancer seemed like an overwhelming task. The process involves provisioning various resources like VPC, security groups, load balancers, and more. However, I then discovered the [aws_ecs_patterns module](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_ecs_patterns-readme.html) within AWS CDK, which provides a convenient way to create common application patterns using a single line of code. One such pre-built pattern is [ApplicationLoadBalancedFargateService](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/python/aws_cdk.aws_ecs_patterns/ApplicationLoadBalancedFargateService.html), which creates all the necessary resources and then deploys your container on it.\n",

    "The beauty of this approach is that while it takes care of setting up all the underlying infrastructure, it also gives you complete control. Everything is defined and deployed through code using CDK. You can version control your infrastructure, enabling easy management and scalability. This combination of control, simplicity, and automation made this the ideal choice. My experience with the previous three AWS services gave me confidence in my understanding of the problem. Thus, armed with this knowledge and the power of AWS CDK, I decided to build the custom stack to deploy my application.\n",

    "## A Practical Look at Pricing: Lightsail vs. Fargate\n",
    "\n",
    "While the custom Fargate solution provides the control and transparency I was looking for, it's important to consider the cost implications. Let’s compare it with the simplicity and pricing of Lightsail to see how they stack up.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lightsail offers a very straightforward and transparent pricing structure. For my initial Streamlit deployment, I used the container service with the Nano option, which has a fixed cost of 7 USD per month. You can see its pricing structure in the screenshot below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/2025-01-21-streamlit-deployment-aws/lightsail-container-pricing.png){.lightbox}\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes it a very appealing choice for quick prototypes and projects that need a budget-friendly setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let’s take a look at the costs associated with the custom Fargate solution. Although Fargate itself is relatively inexpensive, the overall cost can become significantly higher due to other resources like NAT Gateways, Load Balancers, and Elastic IPs that get created along with it. In my setup, the Fargate cost was almost negligible, less than 1 USD. The rest of the cost was distributed in these other services.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most expensive component in this solution is the [NAT Gateways](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html). Since my setup involved deploying the app across two availability zones (`aws_ecs_patterns` enforces high availability), the solution also created two NAT gateways, one for each AZ. The minimum cost of each NAT Gateway is around 32 USD per month, totaling around 64 USD per month for this setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/2025-01-21-streamlit-deployment-aws/natgayeway-pricing.png){.lightbox}\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see from the image, NAT Gateway charges by hour, and it costs $0.045 per hour. If we assume a minimum usage of 30 days a month, it amounts to $32 per month for a single NAT gateway. This is 4 times more expensive than the entire cost of the Lightsail container service.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another significant cost factor is the [Application Load Balancer (ALB)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/introduction.html). With minimum usage, it roughly costs 16 USD per month, which also charges hourly.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/2025-01-21-streamlit-deployment-aws/alb-pricing.png){.lightbox}\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the image, it can be seen that the cost of the ALB is $0.0225 per ALB-hour. For minimum usage it roughly translates to around $16 USD a month.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, two [Elastic IPs (EIPs)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html) are created by the stack (one for each NAT gateway). The cost for these two EIPs is around 7.30 USD per month.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you sum it up, while the actual cost of running the Fargate container itself is barely around 1 USD per month, the cost of NAT gateways, Load Balancer, and EIPs adds up significantly. For this simple setup, I estimate that the cost of this custom Fargate solution would easily amount to around 90 USD per month. This is much higher than the 7 USD per month that I estimated with the Lightsail container service. It's important to note that these costs might vary based on usage, but even with minimal activity, the custom Fargate solution will remain significantly more expensive than the Lightsail option.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the custom Fargate setup does provide more control and transparency, the cost implications are something that you should keep in mind for running your prototypes."

    "## Lessons Learned and Looking Ahead\n",
    "\n",
    "My journey to deploy a Streamlit application on AWS was filled with unexpected challenges, and valuable learning moments. I started with a simple assumption but quickly learned the critical role of WebSockets for Streamlit applications, and the limitations of AWS Lambda and App Runner, which only support HTTP requests. Though AWS Lightsail provided a surprisingly simple solution for deploying the app, I decided to build my own solution with AWS CDK and Fargate for more control.\n",
    "\n",
    "This journey highlighted the importance of understanding your application requirements, and the costs associated with them. While a custom Fargate deployment provides the most control, it also came with hidden costs that made it far more expensive than the simpler Lightsail setup. The most important takeaway for me is that there is not a one size fits all solution, and each deployment strategy comes with its own limitations, and it is critical to understand what we are doing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, the right approach depends on your specific needs. I hope that by sharing my experiences, you can avoid some of the pitfalls I encountered. Thank you for joining me on this journey!"
